# Lesson J: Open an Issue

Issues track work and questions.

Objectives:
- Create a well-scoped issue with clear context.
- Practice lightweight planning before coding.

Key concepts:
- An issue is a lightweight record for bugs, tasks, or discussions.
- Good issues include expected behavior and steps to reproduce (for bugs).

Steps:
1. Go to the repository on GitHub and click the "Issues" tab.
2. Click "New issue".
3. Write a clear title (actionable and specific).
4. Describe the issue:
   - What is happening now
   - What should happen instead
   - Any steps, screenshots, or links
5. Submit the issue.

Verify:
- The issue appears in the list with your title.
- The description contains enough context to act on.

Common pitfalls:
- Vague titles like "bug" or "help".
- Missing steps or expected behavior.
