# Lesson G: Open a Pull Request

A pull request proposes your branch changes for merging.

Objectives:
- Open a PR from your branch to the upstream default branch.
- Provide clear context so reviewers understand the change.

Key concepts:
- A pull request (PR) is a reviewable proposal to merge one branch into another.
- PRs can include titles, descriptions, and checklists.
- Reviewers can comment and request changes before merge.

Steps:
1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open your fork and click "Compare & pull request".
3. Set the base repository and branch (upstream `main`).
4. Set the compare branch to your feature branch.
5. Add a clear title and description:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - How to test (if needed)
6. Submit the PR.

Verify:
- The PR shows the correct base and compare branches.
- The diff matches the changes you expect.

Common pitfalls:
- Opening a PR against the wrong base branch.
- Large PRs that mix unrelated changes.
