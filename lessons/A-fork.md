# Lesson A: Fork the upstream repo

Forking creates your own copy of the repository on GitHub so you can work without affecting the original.

Objectives:
- Create a personal copy of the upstream repo.
- Understand the relationship between your fork and the upstream project.

Key concepts:
- A fork is a server-side copy under your account, separate from the original.
- The original repo is often called "upstream".
- Your fork is where you have full write access.

Steps:
1. Open the upstream repository page on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button (top-right).
3. Choose your account as the destination.
4. Wait for GitHub to create the fork.
5. Confirm the repo shows "forked from <upstream>" near the title.

Verify:
- The repo exists under your account.
- The fork shows the upstream relationship.

Common pitfalls:
- Forking the wrong repo (double-check the repo name).
- Trying to push directly to upstream instead of your fork.

Checklist mapping:
- A) Fork the upstream repo

Tip:
- Check off item A in `PROGRESS.md` after you finish.
