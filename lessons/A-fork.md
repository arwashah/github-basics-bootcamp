# Lesson A: Fork the upstream repo

Forking creates your own copy of the repository on GitHub.

What it is:
- A fork is a server-side copy under your account, separate from the original.

Why it is useful:
- Lets you experiment freely without changing the upstream repo.
- Gives you full control to push branches and open pull requests.

Checklist mapping:
- A) Fork the upstream repo

Tip:
- Check off item A in `PROGRESS.md` after you finish.
