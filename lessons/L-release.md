# Lesson L: Create a release + tag

Releases mark important versions of your project.

Objectives:
- Create a tag for a stable commit.
- Publish a release with notes.

Key concepts:
- A release is a published snapshot of a tagged commit with notes.
- Tags are named pointers to specific commits.
- Semantic versions use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (for example `v1.0.0`).

Steps:
1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click "Releases" then "Draft a new release".
3. Choose a tag:
   - Enter a new tag like `v1.0.0`
   - Select the target branch or commit (usually `main`)
4. Add a release title and notes.
5. Click "Publish release".

Verify:
- The release appears in the Releases list.
- The tag is visible under the "Tags" page.

Common pitfalls:
- Tagging the wrong commit or branch.
- Skipping release notes.

Checklist mapping:
- L) Create a release + tag
