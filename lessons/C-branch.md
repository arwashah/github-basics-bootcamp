# Lesson C: Create a new branch

Branches let you work on changes without touching the default branch.

What it is:
- A branch is a named pointer to a line of commits.

Why it is useful:
- Isolates work so unfinished changes do not affect main.
- Enables multiple features or fixes in parallel.

Checklist mapping:
- C) Create a new branch

Tip:
- Use short, descriptive branch names like `feature/short-name`.
