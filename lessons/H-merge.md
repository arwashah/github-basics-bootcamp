# Lesson H: Merge the PR

Merging brings your changes into the default branch.

Objectives:
- Merge an approved pull request.
- Understand basic merge options.

Key concepts:
- A merge combines commits from your branch into the base branch.
- GitHub offers merge methods: merge commit, squash, and rebase.
- Teams often pick a consistent merge strategy.

Steps:
1. Confirm the PR is approved and checks have passed.
2. Click the merge dropdown and choose the recommended option:
   - "Create a merge commit" (default)
   - "Squash and merge" (single commit)
   - "Rebase and merge" (linear history)
3. Click the merge button and confirm.
4. Optionally delete the branch after merge.

Verify:
- The PR shows "Merged".
- The default branch includes your changes.

Common pitfalls:
- Merging before reviews or checks are complete.
- Picking a merge method that conflicts with team policy.

Checklist mapping:
- H) Merge the PR

Tip:
- Use the default merge option unless instructed otherwise.
